**SoumyaDB** is a lightweight, file-based, multi-table **Database Management System (DBMS)** built in **C**, designed to combine **speed, simplicity, and persistence**. Featuring **B+ tree indexing** for fast record access and SQL-like query support, SoumyaDB is perfect for **learning, research prototypes, and embedded systems**.

## üåü Features

- **Multi-table Support**  
  Store and manage multiple tables with independent schemas.  

- **Persistent Storage**  
  Table schemas and records are saved to disk, allowing data to persist between sessions.

- **B+ Tree Indexing**  
  Fast record lookups by primary key (ID) using a B+ tree structure.

- **SQL-like Query Support**  

```sql
CREATE TABLE table_name (col1 type, col2 type, ...);
INSERT INTO table_name VALUES (val1, 'val2', ...);
SELECT * FROM table_name [WHERE id = value | BETWEEN min AND max];
UPDATE table_name SET col='val' WHERE id=value;
DELETE FROM table_name WHERE id=value;
SHOW TABLES;
DESCRIBE table_name;
```
### üîí Cross-platform File Locking
Ensures safe concurrent access on Windows and Linux.

### üìä Flexible Column Types
Supports INT, FLOAT, and VARCHAR (as strings).

### üèóÔ∏è Lightweight and Modular
Easily extendable for new features like joins, transactions, or indexing improvements.
